# Relay Depository

## Overview

The Relay Depository is a cross-chain protocol that securely manages user deposits and enables controlled withdrawals through a trusted allocator mechanism. It acts as a financial coordination layer across multiple blockchain environments, with implementations for Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains, Solana, and in development for Sui and TON.

At its core, the Relay Depository provides two fundamental operations:

1. **Deposits**: Users can deposit native currencies or tokens into the depository. Each deposit is associated with an ID that links to an intended action or purpose.

2. **Withdrawals**: An authorized allocator can sign withdrawal requests to transfer funds from the depository. These withdrawals are executed as on-chain transactions verified against the allocator's cryptographic signature.

The protocol maintains consistent behavior across all blockchain environments while adapting to each platform's specific features and security models:

- [TON VM (Development)](./docs/TonVMImplementation.md)

## How It Works

The workflow of the Relay Depository follows this pattern:

1. A user deposits funds into the depository contract with an ID
2. The deposit is recorded on-chain with an event
3. Off-chain systems process deposits and prepare execution requests
4. The allocator signs withdrawal requests specifying recipients and amounts
5. Anyone can execute the withdrawal requests on-chain, transferring funds from the depository
6. Each executed withdrawal is recorded on-chain with an event for attestation and tracking

## Security

The Relay Depository contracts have undergone comprehensive security audits:
